## Malaria Prediction Model

- **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of malaria infection based on patient data.
- **Input Features:**  
    - Age  
    - Gender  
    - Symptoms (fever, chills, etc.)  
    - Travel history  
    - Laboratory results
- **Model Type:** Classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Output:** Probability of malaria infection

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Gather patient records and relevant features.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize data.
3. **Model Training:** Train the model using historical data.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
5. **Deployment:** Integrate the model into the application for real-time predictions.

## Disease Trends Visualization

- **Purpose:** Visualize trends for malaria and other diseases over time.
- **Graphs:**
    - **Time Series:** Number of cases per month/year.
    - **Geographical Distribution:** Heatmaps of disease prevalence by region.
    - **Demographic Breakdown:** Incidence by age group and gender.

### Example Graphs

- Line chart: Malaria cases over the past 5 years.
- Bar chart: Comparison of different diseases in a given year.
- Map: Regional hotspots for malaria outbreaks.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand model to predict additional diseases.
- Incorporate real-time data feeds.
- Add advanced analytics (e.g., anomaly detection).
